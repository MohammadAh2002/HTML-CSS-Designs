# Web Projects and Designs
This repository showcases a collection of web projects, designs, and layouts that Iâ€™ve created, ranging from simple web pages and Designs to more complex layouts.
- The repository serves as a display of my work and experiments with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and related technologies.
- The designs span from basic elements and components to complete page layouts.

## Design Organization
Each design in this repository is organized in its own directory to ensure that all files related to a specific project are kept together. In every folder, you will find a README file explaining the details of the project, including its purpose, features, and how to view or run it.
